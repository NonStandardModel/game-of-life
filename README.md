# game-of-life
C implementation of Conway's game of life for the subject of Embedded and Real time systems.

## About
The repository contains two main branches that have diverged too much to be merged again and canbe considered two different implementations. 
* The branch ```master``` contains a straightforward approach.
* The branch ```state-storage-in-bits``` contains a more sofisticated approach that tries to be more memory efficient than the straightforward approach. This is the current state-of-the-art implementation in the repository.
